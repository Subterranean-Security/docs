The universal installer will work on just about every system, but a distribution package may be a more convenient option. With the universal installer GUI Download the universal installer for your operating system. We recommend running the server on a Linux machine because it's convenient to manage the server process with systemd , but it works on Windows and macOS as well. Select \"server\" from the available components and press \"Install\". With a distribution package Pacman (Arch Linux) Download either the stable or development package: # Stable wget https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/snapshot/sandpolis.tar.gz # Development wget https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/snapshot/sandpolis-git.tar.gz Install with makepkg : tar xf sandpolis.tar.gz cd sandpolis makepkg -sif Start and optionally enable the server's systemd unit: sudo systemctl start sandpolisd.service sudo systemctl enable sandpolisd.service With Docker The server can also be run as a Docker container with the following command: sudo docker run --restart unless-stopped sandpolis/sandpolis-server:latest If your container isn't starting on boot, make sure the Docker daemon is configured to start automatically: sudo systemctl enable docker Installing the Viewer There are several official viewer applications that can be used to connect to a server. Not all of them have the same capabilities, so choose the most convenient variant that meets your needs. Sandpolis iOS application The Sandpolis iOS application can be installed from the App Store and supports iPhone and iPad devices running iOS 13.0 or greater. Warning: the iOS app uses Google's Firebase platform for user authentication. If you avoid Google products, use the desktop application instead. Create an account Your account allows you to save multiple servers for easy access and enables several features not possible with other viewer applications. Sandpolis Android application Coming soon... Sandpolis Desktop Viewer Coming soon... Installing the Client With the universal installer GUI If you have the Sandpolis mobile app, you can scan the QR code in the installer to automatically associate the client with the correct server. Generate a client installer A customized installer can be generated from the desktop viewer application that can then be used to install the client on any machine.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting_started/#getting-started","text":"","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting_started/#installing-the-server","text":"There are several different ways to install the server.
